## gstack

Codex uses the global gstack install at `C:/Users/tgira/.codex/skills/gstack`.
That runtime is sourced from the shared checkout at `C:/Users/tgira/.claude/skills/gstack` so Claude Code and Codex stay on the same gstack version.

For browser work in this repo, prefer the gstack browser and QA skills over ad hoc browsing:
- `gstack-browse`
- `gstack-qa`
- `gstack-qa-only`
- `gstack-setup-browser-cookies`
- `gstack-connect-chrome`

Available Codex gstack skills in this environment:
- `gstack`
- `gstack-autoplan`
- `gstack-benchmark`
- `gstack-browse`

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read `convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running `npx convex ai-files install`.
